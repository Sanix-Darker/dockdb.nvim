## TODO

- [ ] Attribute an id to a command-query and persist
    that inside a `/tmp/dockdb.nvim/query_1223`, so that it can be revisit.
- [ ] Manage an history of previous runed queries.
- [ ] Replay previous queries.
- [ ] Fix and optimize all escapes mode ("'/\)
- [ ] Add nvim options to bump/run/pull those images directly too (with a much more config mode available)
